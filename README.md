# GoFindMe
This app will help people find things that they have lost. Using Estimote Beacons, users can find things that people have lost. If you find the lost object, you are given the owner's contact info to get in touch with them. <br />
In the future our team would like to implement an integration with Google Maps so users can visualize the position of lost items. A secure payment system is another feature that we would like to add in the future. This would allow users to safely reward someone who found their lost item without the need to exchange money in real life.
